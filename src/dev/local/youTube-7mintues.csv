1:36,"from around the world are building on Google Cloud."
1:40,"Let's start with Customer Agents."
1:42,"We see three aspects of Customer Agents driving the most impact."
1:48,"You know, one company that's building amazing customer agents"
1:52,"is Snap."
1:53,"They're doing so with Gemini and Vertex AI."
1:56,"Let's hear from Snap CEO, Evan Spiegel."
2:00,"EVAN SPIEGEL: And as we started partnering with Google"
2:03,"and experimenting with Gemini's capability, what we found"
2:06,"was an unbelievable ability to help people solve their problem's"
2:10,"based on visual context."
2:13,"THOMAS KURIAN: GoTo Group, a technology leader"
2:16,"based in Indonesia, has built an agent for their payment app."
2:20,"HANS PATUWO: On our GoPay fintech app, all I have to do"
2:23,"is to press the button and speak."
2:26,"[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]"
2:33,"It processes it and gets me to the exact screen for me"
2:37,"to complete my transaction."
2:38,"And all I have to do is tap a button"
2:40,"and the transaction is done."
2:42,"We work together with Google because Gemini 1.5 gave us"
2:46,"very good latency and also the best-in-class translation module"
2:50,"for in the Indonesian language."
2:52,"THOMAS KURIAN: Part of the magic with Customer Agents"
2:54,"is being able to type or speak simply,"
2:58,"and they can just give you an answer"
3:00,"or take an action for you."
3:02,"RACHAEL ZALUZEC: My VW app and the virtual assistant"
3:04,"are really the collection of so many different points"
3:07,"of information."
3:08,"What we have in our owner's manuals?"
3:09,"What's available online?"
3:11,"And even goes as deep as to give you videos from YouTube."
3:14,"Putting all of the information in one place"
3:16,"and giving you the support that you need."
3:18,"THOMAS KURIAN: You know, there are two specific technologies"
3:20,"I'd like to call out that have been"
3:22,"instrumental in our leadership in Customer Agents."
3:26,"First is our Customer Engagement Suite with Google AI."
3:29,"We also offer search capability to help"
3:33,"retailers and any other company help"
3:37,"customers find the right product and information for their need."
3:41,"All this has led to impressive momentum"
3:45,"with many businesses developing Customer Agents on our platform."
3:49,"We've been hard at work launching"
3:51,"over 300 new Workspace and Gemini"
3:54,"for Workspace features and updates in 2024."
3:58,"First, we're bringing the power of the Gemini"
4:01,"app with enterprise-grade data protection to our customers"
4:05,"as part of their existing Workspace subscription."
4:08,"Second, for our customers subject to regulation,"
4:12,"we know that compliance is paramount."
4:15,"Data Agents."
4:16,"They're like having knowledgeable data analysts,"
4:20,"data engineers, and researchers sitting"
4:23,"right there at your fingertip."
4:25,"One company who has done this amazingly well is Warner Bros."
4:29,"Discovery."
4:30,"HAILE OWUSU: What we're seeing is"
4:31,"something like a 50% reduction in overall costs."
4:35,"Overall, an 80% reduction in the time"
4:37,"it would take to manually caption"
4:39,"a file without the use of machine learning."
4:41,"One of the things that we really appreciate about Vertex AI"
4:43,"is that in addition to the Google Cloud specific models,"
4:48,"the platform is overall pretty agnostic to model choice."
4:51,"And so that kind of flexibility allows"
4:53,"us to really experiment the perfect model"
4:56,"for the particular use case."
4:58,"THOMAS KURIAN: Finally, let's talk"
5:00,"about Creative Agents, which can provide design, writing,"
5:04,"and production help for marketing"
5:06,"teams, audio visual teams, and other creative roles."
5:10,"Agency Tombras use Gemini to build a campaign for PODS"
5:16,"to show geolocated ads on the side of one"
5:20,"of their iconic trucks."
5:22,"CALVIN FIELDS: The result?"
5:23,"A dynamic billboard that actually feels"
5:25,"like it's part of the city."
5:27,"The truck hit all 299 neighborhoods in just 29 hours,"
5:32,"creating more than 6,000 headlines,"
5:34,"a feat that would have been humanly impossible without AI."
5:38,"THOMAS KURIAN: You know, we see many customers building amazing,"
5:42,"cool, creative agents."
5:44,"We're honored to get to work with such amazing companies"
5:48,"and push the envelope with real world AI impact built"
5:53,"on Gemini and our platforms."
5:55,"You all know we're at a pivotal moment in our industry."
6:00,"Together, we're creating a new era of AI agents."
6:04,"And now we have tens of thousands"
6:06,"of companies building amazing stuff every single day"
6:11,"with Google AI."
