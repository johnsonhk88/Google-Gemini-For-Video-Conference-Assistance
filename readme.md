# Googel Gemini For Video Conference Assistance

### Introduction
This project is based on my previous **Kaggle** competition project for  **Google - Gemini Long Context** which require develope the AI application **Demonstrate interesting use cases for Gemini's long context window*. I propose the AI Video Assistant Applciation powered by google Gemini Model capability analysis Long Context Window such as upto 1 hour long Video content. 

#### New approach
Now I refactor this project into a fully End-to-End AI application with Localhost or Cloud service(later) : both front and backend service GUI interfaced for use implementations for Video Assistant directly without Hard coding.
